We reserve the right to immediately terminate your account in our sole discretion, and without prior notice to you if, for example, you violate the Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, if you are a repeat copyright infringer, we will, in appropriate circumstances, permanently terminate your account and remove all of your content from the App.</p>

We reserve the right to delay the completion of any transaction for a reasonable period of time for purposes of fraud detection and otherwise protecting us from illegal or wrongful activities. We also reserve the right to close your account without warning or notice at our sole discretion. PLEASE FAMILARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE RETURN POLICY AND/OR CANCELLATION POLICY PROVIDED BY THE RESPECTIVE THIRD PARTY WEBSITES BEFORE YOU MAKE A PURCHASE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY DISPUTES, FEES AND OTHER CHARGES, INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES.</p>

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and believe that any content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further detail).(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative listing of such works or a link or URL to all such works;(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity on the App and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, including the link or URL for all such material on the App;(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit Luau to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;(v) A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

                            <p>FAILURE TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE INFRINGING CONTENT MAY BE FOUND, WILL RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DMCA NOTIFICATION AND MAY RESULT IN YOUR HAVING TO REPEAT SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE PROCESS.</p>
                            <p>(b)  Notice and Takedown. If we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, we will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing, as described below, or to be the subject of infringing activity. We will also comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter-notification is received, as described below. We may, at our discretion, deny access to the App by, or disable and/or minate the accounts of, Users who may be infringers.</p>
                            <p>(c)  Copyright Counter-Notices. If content you posted on the App was removed for copyright or intellectual property infringement, and you would like to dispute that removal, the process for counter-notifications, which is governed by Section 512(g) of the DMCA, is as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide our Copyright Agent, at the address set forth above, with a written communication that sets forth the items specified below</li>
                                <li>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the accounts of (or access privileges by) Users who are infringers. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes your copyright or the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>(d)  Elements of Counter-Notification. To expedite our ability to process your counter- notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Identify the specific URLs of (or other information sufficient to allow us to identify) material that Luau has removed or to which Luau has disabled access.</li>
                                <li>Provide your full name, address, telephone number, email address and, if you are a registered User, the User name of your Luau account.</li>
                                <li>Provide a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Southern District of New York and the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (if your address is outside of the U.S.A.), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification to our Copyright Agent in accordance with the process outlined above or an agent of such person.</li>
                                <li>Include the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”</li>
                                <li>Sign the notice. If you are providing notice by email, a scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature will be accepted. Send the communication to the following address:
                                    <p>Luau Technologies Inc.<br>21 Pleasant Valley Way<br>West Windsor, NJ 08550<br><a href="mailto:russ@luauet.com">russ@luauet.com</a></p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>(e) After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes any of your Identifying Information set forth in the counter-notification. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having such Identifying Information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant. After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within ten (10) days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the App. If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the items. If we do not receive such notification, we may, but are not obligated to, reinstate the disputed item(s).</p>
                            <p>(f) Foreign Counter-Notification: If you reside outside of the United States, please understand that filing a counter-notice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country and/or the United States of America if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of access privileges for Users who are infringers. So, if you are not sure whether content you posted on the App is being infringed, or are otherwise unsure of whether to file a counter-notification using these procedures, we strongly recommend you first contact a lawyer knowledgeable in the laws of the United States and the State of New York. If you do wish to file a counter-notice, you should follow the process set forth above under the heading “Elements of Counter-Notification.”</p>
